if [ $a = $b ]
then
   echo "$a = $b : a is equal to b"
else
   echo "$a = $b: a is not equal to b"

else
   echo "-n $a : string length is zero"
fi

if [ $a ]
then
   echo "$a : string is not empty"

OUTPUT

abc = efg: a is not equal to b
abc != efg : a is not equal to b
-z abc : string length is not zero

abc : string is not empty


* FILE OPERATION


file="nivedha/nivedha_labs3.txt"
if [ -s $file ]
then
   echo "File size is zero"
 else
   echo "File size is not zero"
  fi
if [ -r $file ]
then
   echo "File has read access"
  else
   echo "File does not have read access"
  fi
if [ -w $file ]
then

  fi
if [ -x $file ]
then
   echo "File has execute permission"
  else
